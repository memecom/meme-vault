## Using Remix

This contract was initially created with truffle in mind but later for upgrading it remix was used.

To run tests, deploy and verify use [remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#lang=en&optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null).
Import is done via workspace burger tab in top left corner. There select clone using link to this repo project will be cloned to the remix.


### Testing
To run test you need to install remix plugin for [remix unit testing](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/unittesting.html) and enable optimization in solidity compiler advence menu (its located in the left menu bar).

### Verification
To verify deployed contract you need to install remix plugin [conttract verification etherscan](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contract_verification.html#etherscan).
That plugin also needs api key for etherscan [see docs](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contract_verification.html#etherscan).
